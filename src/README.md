## The ultimate "Universal App"

####Build once using web technologies and deploy everywhere!
An Electron Ionic application shell for creating Web Apps, Progressive Mobile Web Apps, Native Mobile Apps and Desktop Apps.

This project combines the [Electron Framework] (http://electron.atom.io/) with [Ionic 2](http://ionicframework.com/docs/v2/) and provides a starter for building out an app that can run on either the desktop (macOS, Windows and Linux), a browser or mobile devices (iOS, Android and Windows Phone).  You can use this application to build and run on one or even all of these platforms.

# Credits
This application was built using the [Electron Boilerplate Project] (https://github.com/szwacz/electron-boilerplate/blob/master/README.md) for scaffolding out the Electron application, the [Electron Framework] (http://electron.atom.io/) for creating desktop apps and [Ionic 2](http://ionicframework.com/) for the UI and creating Native Mobile Applications, Progressive Mobile Web Applications and Web Applications.
